# Robotics and Design Project - Spring 2024

Welcome to the Robotics and Design project repository!

This project was developed during the Spring of 2024 for the course **Robotics and Design** at **Politecnico di Milano**. In this repository, you will find all the code and resources used in the final version of our robot, **Rob Ross**.

## Repository Structure

- **main.py**: The main Python script used to control Rob Ross.
- **screen_controller.py**: A Python script to manage the LCD screen.
- **Resources**:
  - G-code files
  - Images for the LCD
  - Libraries and other dependencies

## How to run this on the Raspberry Pi
Everything should already be installed on the raspberry pi and it should start the main.py script automatically when powering on the robot.
